# To the bootcamp organizers
There are two main ways of going through the material in this repository:
1. The long, more detailed route using the notebooks in the folders labeled `1_...` through`5_...`
2. The short, 2-hour route using `Bootcamp main - OLS class (blank).ipynb`

Option 1 was our first attempt at making sure ARE 212 students had a good foundation of python fundementals. This is valuable, but ultimately, we switched to option 2. We did this mainly for two reasons:
- to allow the workshop to be run in a single 2-hour chunk
- to attract more of the students to something fast-paced that would be hyper-focused on the python content in ARE 212

We wanted to avoid duplicating resources provided by online tutorials and the D-lab, and realized in the first year of this workshop that attendence is low (and will drop off) if the bootcamp is multiple sessions and goes too slow for people who have seen some python before.

The resources in the folders are still valuable -- during the 2-hour workshop, it's good to reference those folders as places to "get more information on X if it confuses you."

Advice for future workshops:
- try to limit content and examples to things that the students will see in Ethan Ligon's portion of ARE 212
- limit exposition on topics that can be covered later in the course during a section. This workshop is to get them up and running in python functions and classes as soon as possible, with specific content that they will need (like generating samples from random variable distributions).
- send out a pre-test (see pre-test.md) two weeks before the workshop -- this helps with turn out and helps people realize that even if they have programmed in python before, they may not know some fundemental programming details.
- send out a post-evaluation halfway through the rest of the semester (after April 1) -- this gives them enough time to see what was useful and what they would have benefited more from.

# More details on `Bootcamp main - OLS class (blank).ipynb`
- `Bootcamp main - OLS class (blank).ipynb` is a "blank" version of `Bootcamp main - OLS class.ipynb`, meaning that we have removed the output and solutions to exercises at the end.
- The blank version is meant to be worked through live, during a workshop, with the students also working through it on their laptop.
- There should probably be more time devoted to the students trying to write their own solutions. More exercises thorughout the doc are needed.

# Setting up the JupyterHub repo pull
- See https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller on how to create a link from this repo
- Send out the link to students -- the link should ask them to sign into their JupyterHub account and it will open the specified document.

Good luck and don't hesitate to reach out to Lucy or Aaron!
